# Word Search Kata

## Run tests from command line

TBD - get tests wworking in IDEA first

## Rationale

### DBTDD
Domain-Based TDD

BDD format: test class and method names
#### Ethnological Domain Modeling
The natives' domain models need not be "correct" or in the most efficient form. 
They need to work in a reasonably sustainable way. The developers' domain 
model needs to be tight. If you prefer, you can consider this the distinction
 between the "problem domain" and the "solution domain".

#### Conflict with classical baby-step TDD

#Current commit/release
Adding Result classes so impure functions can return a monad to avoid 
propagating exceptions. These classes are from a separate repository 
(java-fp-utils) - sources are copied here for convenience of reviewers.
