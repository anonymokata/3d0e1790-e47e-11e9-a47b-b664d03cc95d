# Word Search Kata

## Run the program
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/GHogChi/wordsearch.git
2. cd to the root of your local repository
3. Be sure your default Java version is 11
4. Execute the following command:

**java -jar word-search-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar src/test/resources/puzzleSpecExample.txt**

To run with other puzzles, replace the filepath in the above command with the
 path to your puzzle specification file.
 
## Rationale

I chose this kata because it facilitated my exploration of a new approach: 
driving the development of code through tests that reflect a DDD 
perspective. In the course of this kata, I have had to deal with conflicts 
between classic TDD approaches and the necessity of domain analysis.

The word search kata is not exactly a true-to-life task. In the absence of a 
customer to hold a conversation with, I have had to play the customer role 
myself. 

(Question about the "User Stories": is the "Puzzle Solver" supposed 
to be the user? If so, it's strange, because the user is not solving the 
puzzle. If not, this is a personification of a software object that I haven't
 come across before in user stories.)

I have tried to write Java code using clean code techniques derived from
 functional programming. For example, I have used a Result monad I developed 
 to eliminate any (re)throwing of exceptions, a feature of Java its creators 
 have agreed was a mistake.
 
### Straight vs. Kinky 
While examining the sample puzzle, I came across two  "kinky" instances of 
"SULU":

    (13,4) (12, 4) (12, 5) (13, 5)

    (13, 4) (13, 5) (12, 5) (12, 4)
    
In the core Solver algorithm as implemented, those two are found. They are 
not part of the expected result. To satisfy the "straightness" requirement, 
the program executes a method
implemented to filter out such kinky instances. I feel this approach, 
rather than a rewrite of the core algorithm,
 is justified given the general domain of puzzles: we want them to be hard. In a 
real world puzzle environment, we might offer "extra credit" for finding the 
"twisty" instances. (Of course, this kata is not "realistic" in that it 
doesn't generate a puzzle for humans to solve: it solves the puzzle.)

The alternative - changing the algorithm to enforce finding "straight" 
instances only, would make this option impossible. 

Having implemented a test of this filtering method on
 the full 15 x 15 puzzle, which finds only the seven expected instances and 
 runs in less than 30 milliseconds, I would expect the filtering approach to 
 be acceptable. 
 
### Biological metaphor
I organize my code according to an extension of 
[**Hexagonal Architecture**](https://fideloper.com/hexagonal-architecture) I've
 pretentiously name **Semiocytological Architecture**. Basically it divides 
 code 
 into the **nucleus**, which is pure domain model implementation, and the 
 **membrane** containing 
 all the support code (ports, adapters, infrastructure, etc.).

### DBTDD (Domain-Based TDD)

BDD format: test class and method names form complete explanatory sentences.

Not "unit" tests: DBTDD tests are organized around behavior, not classes.

#### Ethnological Domain Modeling
The natives' domain models need not be "correct" or in the most efficient form. 
They only need to work in a reasonably sustainable way. The developers' domain 
model needs to be tight. If you prefer, you can consider this the distinction
 between the "problem domain" and the "solution domain".

It inevitably seems waterfallish to try to construct a domain model before 
generating user stories, but this is a matter of trying to formalize the 
analysis activities that go on during the so-called "discovery" and 
"inception" processes. The domain model is never cast in stone and can be 
changed at any time during development. As in classical XP, there should be 
no "BA" silo doing this: all team members should be involved.

For this kata, I spent some time looking over the "specifications" (the 
"native domain model").  The 
section on "Straight vs. Kinky" above came out of that work.
